# Wine-Quality-prediction
Developed a wine quality prediction model using machine learning techniques like Logistic Regression, SVM, and Random Forest, with ensemble methods (AdaBoost, Gradient Boosting). The model, built with Python, Pandas, Scikit-learn, and Flask, was deployed as a web app allowing users to input wine characteristics for quality predictions.
